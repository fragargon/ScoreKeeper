# Project Specifications

## Layout

1. **Game Chosen**. The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.
2. **Overall layout**. App is divided into two columns, one for each team.
3. **Column contents**. Each column contains a large [TextView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html) to keep track of the current score for that team. Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such as fouls can be added.
4. **Score buttons**. Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either:
   * Each track a different kind of scoring or
   * Each track a different metric (one score, the other fouls, for instance).
5. **Reset button**. The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
6. **Best practices**. The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
   * Text sizes are defined in sp.
   * Lengths are defined in dp.
   * Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

____________

This is a simple app, the goal was to create an app which gave the user the ability to keep track the score of 2 different teams.
